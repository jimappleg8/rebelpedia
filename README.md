# Rebelpedia
An open artifacts encyclopedia for viewers of Rebel Wisdom

## About the Project
The films released by [RebelWisdom.co.uk](https://www.RebelWisdom.co.uk/) discuss complex ideas and often include concepts and terminology that are not well-known to many of their viewers. Because existing language doesn't always communicated new ideas very well, the meaning of words and phrases used are often different from their traditional meanings in subtle and nuanced ways.

As a result, there have been calls from the Rebel Wisdom community for some kind of reference (a glossary or perhaps a more encyclopedic work) that can help those who have questions around specific words or concepts.

This is an unofficial project that will try to provide that reference by asking for the participation of the Rebel Wisdom community itself.

## Contributing to the project
Ultimately, I think the project may take the form of a wiki that anyone can edit and add to, much like Wikipedia. For now, I've created a Google Doc that can be used to contribute. Here is the link:

If you are interested in helping choose software or other technical aspects of this project, please contact Jim Applegate at jimappleg8@gmail.com and we'll figure it out.

## Open Artifacts
An open artifacts project is much like an open source software project except that it is not limited to software. It can include anything from written documents like this one to building blueprints, to technological designs, and more. The key is to attach an appropriate license to the work so it can stay free for use by others.

In the case of this project, we are using the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License: [](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)

When adding information to this document, you need to keep in mind the copyrights of the people your are sourcing for information. Unless they also have a comparable license on their work, it is still copyrighted and you will need to treat it as such.
