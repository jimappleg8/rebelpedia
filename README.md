# Rebelpedia
An open source encyclopedia for viewers of Rebel Wisdom

## Open Artifacts
An open artifacts project is much like an open source software project except that it is not limited to software. It can include anything from written documents like this one to building blueprints, to technological designs, and more. The key is to attach an appropriate license to the work so it can stay free for use by others.

In the case of this project, we are using the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License: (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)

When adding information to this document, you need to keep in mind the copyrights of the people your are sourcing for information. Unless they also have a comparable license on their work, it is still copyrighted and you will need to treat it as such.

## Contributing to the project
Ultimately, I think the project may take the form of a wiki that anyone can edit and add to, much like Wikipedia. For now, I've created a Google Document that can be used to contribute. Here is the link:

If you are interested in helping choose software or other technical aspects of this project, please contact Jim Applegate at jimappleg8@gmail.com and we'll figure it out.
